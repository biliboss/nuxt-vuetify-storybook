> A test with storybook configuration

## Problem

After a painful experience trying to setup storybook in a Nuxt + Vuetify application, I created this repo to trying to solve this enigma

## Solving

1. Create Nuxt Project ith Vuetify
2. Add Storybook with auto setup
3. The key is the config.js in .storybook
